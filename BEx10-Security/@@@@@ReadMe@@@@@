Angular Creating and Reusing Libraries & Security Implementation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Library Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Create a library by issuing the below command in an existing Angular project. This will create the library in the projects folder
    
    ng generate library my-lib

2. This command updates the angular.json config to include a new entry in the "projects" section. This entry is made of type "library"
3. Building, Testing and Linting the project can be done with the following commands
    
    ng build my-lib --configuration development
    ng test my-lib
    ng lint my-lib

4. Publishing the library to npm registry is done with the below commands
    ng build my-lib
    cd dist/my-lib
    npm publish

5. Using the library in the same project involves 
    a. Building the library
        
        ng build my-lib --watch

    b. Importing the library, where it is needed using the below import statement      
        import { myExport } from 'my-lib';

6. Using the library in a different project
    a. Navigate to the library project's output directory & run the command
    
    npm link
    
    You may have to trigger ng build once, so that the output directory exists. This will make your library locally available on your machine.
    
    b. Navigate to the application which needs the library and run the command
    
     npm link [name_of_your_module]
    
    c. Add "preserveSymlinks": true to your angular.json file under projects > architect > build
    Run your main application with ng serve, make some changes in your library, build it. 
    d. Once development is done, you can unlink your dependency from your main application by running the command 
    e. npm unlink [name_of_your_module] in your main application's root directory. Go to your angular library project directory and run npm unlink so that your library isn't locally available anymore. 
    f. You can now publish your changes and intall your latest version with npm install in your main application.
    g. Remember it has to be the dist output folder since the angular cli does not support directly linking your library.
